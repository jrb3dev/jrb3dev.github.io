Hello, world!
Greetings from the Atlanta (GA, US) region!

Me?

Long-serving polyglot software-system developer/tester/admin, mostly Unixen.
Played on all levels of infrastructure, from voltage on up.
(I helped decommission the ARPAnet in the 1980's, if that orients you.)

Agile coach, mentor; proponent since before Agile grew big.
Have taught Scrum, and used that, Extreme Programming, and other variants.

Aggregate excess benefit provided to my clients and employers > +1.00e9 USD.
This includes cutting three months off an operating system release,
and defending a million-dollar-a-day revenue stream for nine months.

Have used over a dozen computer languages for pay,
including Ruby, Perl, C++, C, Java, FORTH, shells, and several assembly.
Currently prefer working within Debian (Linux), Rails (Ruby), Perl ecosystems.
